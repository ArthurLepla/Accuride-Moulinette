_**Assistant**_

<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out why the form isn't using the route.ts and why there's a 404 error. The user mentioned that when trying to load connectionNames, there's a GET request to /api/adapters/[id]/browse which returns 404. 

Looking at the provided code, the route for /api/adapters/[id]/browse is defined in src/app/api/adapters/[id]/browse/route.ts. The GET function there seems correct. But the error is 404, which suggests the route isn't being found. 

Wait, in Next.js 13+, API routes are structured under app/api, and the folder structure should match the route. The [id] is a dynamic segment. So the path should be /api/adapters/{id}/browse. But maybe there's an issue with how the parameters are handled.

Looking at the fetch call in the sandbox/page.tsx, the code is fetching /api/adapters/${selectedConnection}/browse. The selectedConnection is the adapter ID. But in the route.ts, the parameter is named 'id'. That should be okay because the folder is [id], so the params should have 'id' as the key. 

Wait, in the route.ts, the function is using params.id, which is correct. So why the 404? Maybe the adapter ID isn't correctly passed. Let me check the logs. The user provided a console log showing the XHRGET to http://localhost:3000/api/adapters/79894682fe424b409d954bd6cf0fda6b/browse which 404s. 

Hmm, maybe the route isn't properly structured. In Next.js, for dynamic routes, the folder should be [id], and the file should be inside a subdirectory. Wait, the route.ts is in src/app/api/adapters/[id]/browse/route.ts. That would correspond to /api/adapters/[id]/browse, which should match the request. 

Wait, but in Next.js, the route structure is based on folders. So the path /api/adapters/[id]/browse would require the route.ts to be in app/api/adapters/[id]/browse/route.ts, which it is. So that's correct. 

Another possibility: the server isn't picking up the dynamic route. Maybe a typo in the folder name? The user's code shows the file is named route.ts correctly. 

Wait, looking at the error message: the response from the API is 404. So the server isn't finding that endpoint. Maybe the server isn't running or there's a deployment issue. But assuming the server is running, perhaps the issue is with the way the headers are passed. 

In the sandbox/page.tsx, the fetch call is adding the 'X-Auth-Config' header. But in the route.ts, the code is reading 'x-auth-config' (lowercase). HTTP headers are case-insensitive, but maybe there's an issue. However, in Next.js, the headers() function from next/headers returns them in lowercase. Wait, in the route.ts, line 12 uses headersList.get('x-auth-config'), which is correct. So the header is being sent as 'X-Auth-Config' and read as 'x-auth-config', which should be okay. 

Another angle: the API URL constructed in the route.ts is using config.iedIp. Maybe the config is incorrect. For example, if config.iedIp is not properly set, the URL might be malformed. But the logs show that the API URL is being logged, so we can check that. 

In the route.ts, line 33 constructs the API URL as `https://${config.iedIp}/DataService/Adapters/${adapterId}/browse`. If config.iedIp is empty or incorrect, this would result in a bad URL. But the user's logs show that the API call is to the correct URL? Or maybe the external API is returning 404. 

Wait, the error is from the Next.js API route, not the external API. The 404 is on the Next.js server, meaning the route isn't found. That suggests that the route.ts file isn't being recognized. 

Possible reasons: 

1. The file is not in the correct location. The path should be app/api/adapters/[id]/browse/route.ts. The user's code shows this is the case.

2. Next.js isn't reloading the routes. Maybe a server restart is needed, but in development mode, it should hot-reload.

3. The [id] folder is not properly named. Maybe it's named something else, but the user's code shows [id].

Wait, looking at the provided code for the route.ts, the export is async function GET, which is correct. 

Another possibility: the adapter ID being passed has characters that Next.js doesn't route correctly. For example, if the ID includes slashes or special characters, but in the example, the ID is a UUID-like string which should be fine.

Wait, the error in the console is a 404 from the Next.js server when calling /api/adapters/[id]/browse. That means the Next.js server doesn't have a route handler for that path. So the route.ts isn't being picked up. 

Why? Maybe the folder structure is incorrect. Let me check again. The route.ts is in src/app/api/adapters/[id]/browse/route.ts. So the path is /api/adapters/:id/browse, which should be correct. 

Wait, in Next.js, each segment in the app directory corresponds to a route. So [id] is a dynamic segment, and inside it, the browse folder would be a static segment. So the full path is /api/adapters/[id]/browse. That should work. 

But maybe there's a typo in the folder name. The user's code shows the file is in [id]/browse/route.ts. That's correct. 

Another angle: the Next.js server might have a configuration issue. Maybe the project isn't built correctly, or there's a caching problem. But in development mode, this should be handled. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the route is in a client component, but Next.js API routes are server-side. No, the API routes are separate. 

Wait, the error message in the console is from the client-side fetch call. The response is 404, which means the API route isn't found. So the issue is definitely with the Next.js API route not being correctly set up. 

Looking back at the route.ts code, perhaps there's a syntax error that's preventing the route from being registered. Let me check the code again. 

In the provided route.ts for /api/adapters/[id]/browse, the code seems correct. The function is exported as GET, and it's using the params correctly. 

Wait, in the sandbox/page.tsx, the useEffect that fetches the connectionNames is in a client component. The fetch call is to /api/adapters/${selectedConnection}/browse. If selectedConnection is not set, this would be /api/adapters//browse, but the logs show a valid ID. 

Wait, the error log shows the URL http://localhost:3000/api/adapters/79894682fe424b409d954bd6cf0fda6b/browse, which is correct. So the ID is present. 

Another possibility: the route.ts is not exporting the correct HTTP method. For example, if it's exporting POST instead of GET. But in the code, it's export async function GET, which is correct. 

Wait, looking at the code for the route.ts, line 4-7: 

export async function GET(
  request: Request,
  { params }: { params: { id: string } }
) {

Yes, that's correct. The params are destructured as { id }, which matches the [id] folder. 

Hmm. Maybe the issue is that the route is not properly handling the dynamic parameter. For example, if the ID is not being parsed correctly. 

In the route.ts, line 23: const adapterId = params.id; which is correct. 

But wait, in the sandbox/page.tsx, when fetching the connectionNames, the code is:

const response = await fetch(`/api/adapters/${selectedConnection}/browse`, {
  headers: {
    'X-Auth-Config': JSON.stringify(authConfig)
  }
});

But in the route.ts, the code is expecting the X-Auth-Config header. The route.ts reads it via headersList.get('x-auth-config'), which should work as headers are case-insensitive. 

But maybe the header isn't being sent correctly. Let me check the code in sandbox/page.tsx. 

In the useEffect for loading connectionNames (lines 187-252 in the provided code), the fetch is done with headers: { 'X-Auth-Config': ... }, which is correct. 

Wait, but in Next.js, when using the fetch API on the client side, certain headers are restricted unless the API route is configured to accept them. However, since this is a custom header (X-Auth-Config), the API route needs to handle CORS if the client and server are on different domains. But in this case, they're on the same domain (localhost:3000), so CORS shouldn't be an issue. 

Alternatively, the API route might not be receiving the header. To check, in the route.ts, log the headersList to see if the x-auth-config is present. 

In the route.ts, line 11-12: 

const headersList = await headers();
const authConfig = headersList.get('x-auth-config');

If the header isn't present here, that would cause the 401 error, but the user's error is 404, which suggests the route isn't found. 

Wait, the 404 is from the Next.js server, meaning the route doesn't exist. So the problem is that the route.ts isn't being recognized. 

Possible reasons: 

- The file is not in the correct location. The user's code shows it's in src/app/api/adapters/[id]/browse/route.ts. But in Next.js, the app directory is usually at the root. So if the project is structured with src/app, that's correct. 

- The Next.js version doesn't support dynamic routes in the app directory. Wait, Next.js 13+ does support dynamic routes in app/api. But maybe the user is using an older version. 

Alternatively, maybe the folder name is incorrect. For example, using [id] instead of [id] as a dynamic segment. But the code shows [id] is used. 

Another angle: the route.ts is missing. Maybe the file wasn't saved or is in the wrong place. But the user provided the code, so assuming it's there. 

Wait, looking at the error message again: the XHRGET is to /api/adapters/79894682fe424b409d954bd6cf0fda6b/browse and returns 404. So the server isn't handling that route. 

This suggests that the route.ts isn't properly set up. Maybe the route.ts is in the wrong directory. For example, if it's in src/app/api/adapters/[id]/browse.ts instead of browse/route.ts. But the user's code shows it's in browse/route.ts. 

Wait, in Next.js 13+, API routes in the app directory require the route handler to be in a route.ts file inside the appropriate directory. So the structure should be correct. 

Another possibility: the project is using the pages directory instead of the app directory for API routes. If the project has a pages/api directory, it would take precedence over app/api. But the user's code shows the API routes are in app/api, so if there's a conflicting pages/api directory, that could cause issues. 

The user should check if there's a pages/api directory that's overriding the app/api routes. If so, removing or renaming it would resolve the conflict. 

In summary, the most likely cause is that the Next.js server isn't recognizing the dynamic route in the app/api directory, possibly due to a conflicting pages/api structure or incorrect folder naming. The 404 indicates the route isn't found, so the problem is with the route setup rather than the code inside the route.ts.
</think>

D'après le code et les erreurs fournis, le problème principal vient de la route `/api/adapters/[id]/browse` qui retourne une 404. Voici l'analyse et la solution :

**Problème identifié :**
La structure des fichiers de route Next.js n'est pas alignée avec le schéma d'URL attendu. Le fichier `src/app/api/adapters/[id]/browse/route.ts` devrait gérer `/api/adapters/{id}/browse` mais reçoit une 404.

**Solution :**
1. Vérifiez la structure des dossiers qui devrait être :
```
src/app/
└── api/
    └── adapters/
        └── [id]/
            └── browse/
                └── route.ts  <-- Ce fichier existe déjà
```

2. Dans `sandbox/page.tsx`, le fetch vers l'API utilise le header `X-Auth-Config` mais la récupération dans la route se fait via `x-auth-config` (minuscules). Bien que les headers HTTP soient case-insensitive, il serait plus cohérent d'utiliser la même casse partout :


```207:211:src/app/sandbox/page.tsx
        const response = await fetch(`/api/adapters/${selectedConnection}/browse`, {
          headers: {
            'X-Auth-Config': JSON.stringify(authConfig)
          }
        });
```


3. Vérifiez que l'`adapterId` passé dans l'URL correspond bien à un adapter existant. Les logs montrent une tentative avec l'ID `79894682fe424b409d954bd6cf0fda6b`.

**Pour le message d'erreur de source map** (installHook.js.map 404), ceci est une erreur de développement sans impact fonctionnel, généralement causée par des extensions de navigateur ou des outils de développement. Vous pouvez l'ignorer en environnement de développement.

La combinaison de ces éléments explique pourquoi le formulaire ne parvient pas à récupérer les `connectionNames` - l'API endpoint n'est pas correctement résolu par le routeur Next.js.
